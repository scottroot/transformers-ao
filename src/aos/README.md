# AOS source files
* ## What these are
  * These are the AOS lua source files typically found in the "process" folder when building a new AOS module with the AO dev-cli tool.
  * [github.com/permaweb/aos/process](https://github.com/permaweb/aos/tree/main/process)
* ## Why AOS source files in Rust?
  * In order to expand the functionality of the current AO/AOS capabilities
  * Avoid rewriting the logic in Rust (although there would likely be numerous benefits) so that the frequent updates to AOS can easily be copied and pasted into the relevant file here
